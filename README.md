# Voice-Assistant
This is a voice assistant project, it does not use NLP or anything related machine learning. 
It is purely based python modules.

Features included so far are:-
> Sending a message on Whatsapp,
> Speech/text translation,
> Google/wiki searches,
> World clock,
> Watching videos and listening to music on youtube
 
Run main.py to use the voice assistant.
A demo audio will be included in the near future to understand how to speak to the voice assistant.
 
Please keep in my mind that you need to have a strong internet connection while using the voice assistant.
Please get rid of the sample name and number in the csv file before running the program.

Bugs to be fixed:
> Handling inaccurate speech recognition for numeric data.
> Clicking enter when sending the message (glitch in pywhatkit, does work at times).
