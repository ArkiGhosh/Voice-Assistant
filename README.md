# Voice-Assistant
This is a voice assistant project, it does not use NLP or anything related machine learning. 
It is purely based python modules.

Features included so far are:-
-> Sending a message on Whatsapp
-> Speech/text translation
-> Google/wiki searches
-> World clock
-> Watching videos and listening to music on youtube
 
A demo audio will be included in the near future to understand how to speak to the voice assistant.
 
Please keep in my mind that you need to have a strong internet connection while using the voice assistant.
